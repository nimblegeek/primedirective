# The Prime Directive

This practice project is about building a PrimeDirective.java program that creates an ```ArrayList```of all prime numbers in an array.
As part of the [Create  REST APIs with Spring and Java course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-rest-apis-with-spring-and-java).

# General Description 
Finding prime numbers is a common technical challenge in programming interviews.

As it happens, Java loops are a great tool to help you do this!

A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not.
